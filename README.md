# PROGLAN Activity 1: Text-based Game

This is a digital adventure game where the main goal is to defuse a bomb. Initially, the player wakes up from his/her sleep. Upon waking up, the player sees a bomb and must defuse it in order to win. Throughout the whole game, there are hints scattered all over the house on how to defuse the bomb, as well as notes about the kidnapperâ€™s personality. There are also instances where the player must solve puzzles in order to obtain the item/s he/she needs. To accomplish these tasks, the player enters commands in the form of simple imperative sentences or two-word verb/noun phrases. A module with the functionalities of a parser is used to recognize these commands and map them to their corresponding actions. This results to a game in which the user can interact with objects through a variety of commands.
